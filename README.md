A drawing tool designed for use with tablet and pen.
Initially implemented for SFPC Fall 2016 student final showcase,
it was projected onto a glass and wood paned door.  Participants
used a pen which combined an ink nib and a Wacom tablet stylus
so that their marks were made simultaneously on paper and 
captured in this sketch to be projected onto the panes of the 
door.
